TASK 1 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
Create a basic chatbot designed for simple conversational interactions. It can respond to greetings, share information about itself, tell jokes and interesting facts, and provide the current time when asked. Users interact with the chatbot, and it maintains the conversation until the user types "bye" to end the session. This beginner-friendly project is ideal for learning about natural language processing and fundamental AI concepts, serving as an educational tool for Python developers interested in building their own chatbots.

TASK 2 : TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
This Python project constructs a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a challenging AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm. The user-friendly graphical interface, built with Tkinter, facilitates both single-player and multiplayer experiences. Players can enjoy seamless gameplay with intuitive controls and easy game resets, making it a valuable learning tool for beginner and intermediate Python developers interested in game development and AI implementation.

TASK 3 : RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project outlines a rule-based movie recommendation system implemented in Python. The system prioritizes user-driven preferences to provide relevant film suggestions. Users can define their interests through factors such as genre, director, or preferred actors. The core recommendation engine utilizes conditional logic to match user input with corresponding movie attributes, resulting in a curated list of recommendations. This initial framework serves as a foundation for future enhancements, including the integration of more sophisticated recommendation algorithms. Additionally, the system can be designed to leverage user data for a more personalized recommendation experience.
